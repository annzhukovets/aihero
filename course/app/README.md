# 🤖 AI FAQ Assistant for DataTalksClub

An AI-powered assistant that helps students quickly find answers to FAQ questions from [DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq) courses.  
Built as a project for the [AI Agents Crash Course](https://alexeygrigorev.com/aihero/).


## Overview

Students often struggle to navigate large FAQ documents. This project solves that problem by providing a conversational assistant that:
- Searches the **DataTalksClub/faq** repository  
- Retrieves the most relevant content  
- Generates helpful answers with references to the original materials  

Why it's useful:

- No more endless scrolling through Markdown docs  
- Direct links to the source in the GitHub repo  
- Interactive chat interface (via Streamlit) and CLI mode

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.9+  
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) 

```bash
# Make sure you have uv
pip install uv

# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/aihero.git
cd aihero/code

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

For API key management, we recommend using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) (see [`.envrc_template`](.envrc_template)).


## Usage

### API key

Set up your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### CLI mode  

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This opens an interactive CLI environment. You can ask the conversational agent any question about the course.

Type `stop` to exit.  

### Web UI mode  

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

This launches a Streamlit app. You can chat with the assistant in your browser.  

The app is available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).


## Features

- 🔎 Search over FAQ Markdown files with `minsearch`  
- 🤖 AI-generated answers powered by `pydantic-ai` + OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`)  
- 📂 Direct GitHub references in answers
- 🖥️ Two interfaces: CLI (`main.py`) and Streamlit (`app.py`)  
- 📝 Automatic logging of conversations into JSON files (`logs/`)  


## Evaluations

We evaluate the agent using the following criteria:

- `instructions_follow`: The agent followed the user's instructions
- `instructions_avoid`: The agent avoided doing things it was told not to do  
- `answer_relevant`: The response directly addresses the user's question  
- `answer_clear`: The answer is clear and correct  
- `answer_citations`: The response includes proper citations or sources when required  
- `completeness`: The response is complete and covers all key aspects of the request
- `tool_call_search`: Is the search tool invoked? 

We do this in two steps:

- First, we generate synthetic questions (see [`eval/data-gen.ipynb`](eval/data-gen.ipynb))
- Next, we run our agent on the generated questions and check the criteria (see [`eval/evaluations.ipynb`](eval/evaluations.ipynb))

Current evaluation metrics:

```
instructions_follow    100.0
instructions_avoid     100.0
answer_relevant        100.0
answer_clear           100.0
answer_citations       100.0
completeness            70.0
tool_call_search       100.0
```

The most important metric for this project is `answer_relevant`. This measures whether the system's answer is relevant to the user. It's currently 100%, meaning all answers were relevant. 

Improvements: Our evaluation is currently based on only 10 questions. We need to collect more data for a more comprehensive evaluation set.


## Project file overview

`main.py`: Entry point for the CLI version of the assistant  
- Loads and indexes FAQ data  
- Initializes the search agent  
- Provides an interactive loop where users can type questions and get answers  
- Logs each interaction to a JSON file

`app.py`: Streamlit-based web UI for the assistant  
- Provides a chat-like interface in the browser  
- Streams assistant responses in real time  
- Logs all interactions into JSON files

`ingest.py`: Handles data ingestion and indexing from the GitHub FAQ repository
- Downloads the repository ZIP archive  
- Extracts `.md` and `.mdx` files  
- Optionally chunks documents into smaller windows  
- Builds a `minsearch` index for fast text-based retrieval

`search_tools.py`: Defines the search tool used by the agent  
- Wraps the `minsearch` index into a simple API  
- Provides a `search(query)` tool that retrieves up to 5 results

`search_agent.py`: Defines and configures the AI Agent  
- Uses `pydantic-ai` to build the agent  
- Loads a system prompt template that instructs the assistant on how to answer FAQ questions  
- Attaches the search tool so the agent can query the FAQ index  
- Configured with the `gpt-4o-mini` model

`logs.py`: Utility for logging all interactions  
- Serializes messages, prompts, and model metadata  
- Stores logs in JSON files in the `logs/` directory (configurable via `LOGS_DIRECTORY`)  
- Ensures each log has a timestamp and unique filename


## Tests

TODO: add tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

(Currently minimal test coverage; contributions welcome.)  


## Deployment

To deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud:

Generate a `requirements.txt` file from your `uv` environment:

```bash
uv export > requirements.txt
```

Make sure it's pushed along with the latest changes.

Next, run the application locally:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

Click "deploy", connect your GitHub repo, and configure deployment settings.

In the settings, make sure you configure `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Once configured, Streamlit Cloud will automatically detect changes. It will redeploy your app whenever you push updates.
